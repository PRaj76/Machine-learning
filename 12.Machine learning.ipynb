    "1. What is prior probability? Give an example.\n",
    "Ans:- You can think of posterior probability as an adjustment on prior probability: Posterior probability = prior \n",
    "        probability + new evidence (called likelihood). For example, historical data suggests that around 60% of students \n",
    "        who start college will graduate within 6 years. This is the prior probability.\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. What is posterior probability? Give an example.\n",
    "Ans:-Posterior probability is a revised probability that takes into account new available information. \n",
    "    For example, let there be two urns, urn A having 5 black balls and 10 red balls and urn B having 10 black balls and 5 \n",
    "    red balls. Now if an urn is selected at random, the probability that urn A is chosen is 0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. What is likelihood probability? Give an example.\n",
    "Ans:-Suppose we have a coin that is assumed to be fair. If we flip the coin one time, the probability that it will land on\n",
    "    heads is 0.5. Now suppose we flip the coin 100 times and it only lands on heads 17 times. We would say that the \n",
    "    likelihood that the coin is fair is quite low.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Thus the likelihood principle implies that likelihood function can be used to compare the plausibility of various \n",
    "    parameter values. For example, if L(θ2|x)=2L(θ1|x) and L(θ|x) ∝ L(θ|y) ∀ θ, then L(θ2|y)=2L(θ1|y). Therefore, whether\n",
    "    we observed x or y we would come to the conclusion that θ2 is twice as plausible as θ1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. What is Naïve Bayes classifier? Why is it named so?\n",
    "Ans:- Naive Bayes is called naive because it assumes that each input variable is independent. This is a strong assumption \n",
    "    and unrealistic for real data; however, the technique is very effective on a large range of complex problems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5.  What is optimal Bayes classifier?\n",
    "Ans:- Bayes Optimal Classifier is a probabilistic model that finds the most probable prediction using the training data\n",
    "    and space of hypotheses to make a prediction for a new data instance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Write any two features of Bayesian learning methods.\n",
    "Ans:- A probability distribution over observed data for each possible hypothesis. New instances can be classified by\n",
    "    combining the predictions of multiple hypotheses, weighted by their probabilities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. Define the concept of consistent learners.\n",
    "Ans:- a learning algorithm is a consistent learner if it commits zero errors over the training examples.\n",
    "    every consistent learner outputs a MAP hypothesis if 1) we assume a uniform prior probability distribution over H\n",
    "    and if 2) we assume a deterministic noise free training data\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. Write any two strengths of Bayes classifier.\n",
    "Ans:- This algorithm works quickly and can save a lot of time. Naive Bayes is suitable for solving multi-class\n",
    "    prediction problems. If its assumption of the independence of features holds true, it can perform better than other \n",
    "    models and requires much less training data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. Write any two weaknesses of Bayes classifier.\n",
    "Ans:-Disadvantages of Using Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    ".Conditional Independence Assumption does not always hold...\n",
    ".Zero probability problem : When we encounter words in the test data for a particular class that are not present in the \n",
    "    training data, we might end up with zero class probabilities.\n",
    "    \n",

    "Ans:- Navie Bayes Classifier is used for:\n",
    "\n",
    ".Text classification:-\n",
    "    The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple classifier that classifies based on probabilities of events. It is the applied \n",
    "    commonly to text classification. With the training set, we can train a Naive Bayes classifier which we can use to\n",
    "    automaticall categorize a new sentence.\n",
    ".Spam filtering:-\n",
    "    Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam \n",
    "    and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam. It is \n",
    "    one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.\n",
    ".Market sentiment analysis:-\n",
    "      Market Sentiment analysis is a field dedicated to extracting subjective emotions and feelings from text. One common\n",
    "        use of sentiment analysis is to figure out if a text expresses negative or positive feelings. Naive Bayes is a \n",
    "        popular algorithm for classifying text."
