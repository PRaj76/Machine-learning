    "1. In the sense of machine learning, what is a model? What is the best way to train a model?\n",
    "Ans:- A training model is a dataset that is used to train an ML algorithm. It consists of the sample output data and the\n",
    "    corresponding sets of input data that have an influence on the output. The training model is used to run the input\n",
    "    data through the algorithm to correlate the processed output against the sample output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. In the sense of machine learning, explain the \"No Free Lunch\" theorem.\n",
    "Ans:- The “no free lunch” (NFL) theorem for supervised machine learning is a theorem that essentially implies that no\n",
    "    single machine learning algorithm is universally the best-performing algorithm for all problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe the K-fold cross-validation mechanism in detail.\n",
    "Ans:- Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.\n",
    "    The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be\n",
    "    split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Describe the bootstrap sampling method. What is the aim of it?\n",
    "Ans:-The bootstrap method is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with\n",
    "    replacement. It can be used to estimate summary statistics such as the mean or standard deviation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. What is the significance of calculating the Kappa value for a classification model? Demonstrate\n",
    "how to measure the Kappa value of a classification model using a sample collection of results.\n",
    "Ans:- Ans: Kappa value or Cohen's Kappa coefficient is an evaluation metric for classification models. Its significance as \n",
    "        an evaluation metric is that it can be used to evaluate multi class classification models and also works on models \n",
    "        trained on imbalanced datasets(scores like accuracy scores fail for imbalanced datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler words It basically tells you how much better your classifier is performing over the performance of a classifier \n",
    "that simply guesses at random according to the frequency of each class. Cohen's kappa is always less than or equal to \n",
    "1. Values of 0 or less, indicate that the classifier is useless Cohen suggested the Kappa result be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "    values ≤ 0 as indicating no agreement and 0.01–0.20 as none to slight, 0.21–0.40 as fair, 0.41– 0.60 as moderate, \n",
    "    0.61–0.80 as substantial, and 0.81–1.00 as almost perfect agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Describe the model ensemble method. In machine learning, what part does it play?\n",
    "Ans:-In this ensemble technique, machine learning professionals use a number of models for making predictions about each \n",
    "    data point. The predictions made by different models are taken as separate votes. Subsequently, the prediction made \n",
    "    by most models is treated as the ultimate prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is a descriptive model's main purpose? Give examples of real-world problems that\n",
    "descriptive models were used to solve.\n",
    "Ans:- A descriptive model describes a system or other entity and its relationship to its environment. It is generally used \n",
    "    to help specify and/or understand what the system is, what it does, and how it does it. A geometric model or spatial \n",
    "    model is a descriptive model that represents geometric and/or spatial relationships.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An example of model is when you build a small scale airplane. An example of model is when you copy your older \n",
    "    sibling's behavior. The definition of a model is a specific design of a product or a person who displays clothes,\n",
    "    poses for an artist. An example of a model is a hatch back version of a car.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. Describe how to evaluate a linear regression model.\n",
    "Ans:-There are 3 main metrics for model evaluation in regression:\n",

    "    .Underfitting is a situation arising when the hypothesis is way too simple, or when the machine learning model is way too simple to produce good results.\n",
    "    .Overfitting is a situation arising when the hypothesis is way too complex, or when the machine learning model is way too complex to produce good results.\n",
    "    .Underfitting causes a model to produce poor results due to heavily simplified algorithm reacting lightly to changes in the unseen data for independent variables from the training data.\n",
