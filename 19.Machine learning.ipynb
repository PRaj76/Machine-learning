    "2. Describe how the Market Basket Research makes use of association analysis concepts.\n",
    "Ans:- A data mining technique that is used to uncover purchase patterns in any retail setting is known as Market Basket\n",
    "    Analysis. In simple terms Basically, Market basket analysis in data mining is to analyze the combination of products\n",
    "    which been bought together.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a technique that gives the careful study of purchases done by a customer in a supermarket. This concept identifies\n",
    "the pattern of frequent purchase items by customers. This analysis can help to promote deals, offers, sale by the\n",
    "companies, and data mining techniques helps to achieve this analysis task. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    ".Data mining concepts are in use for Sales and marketing to provide better customer service, to improve cross-selling\n",
    "   opportunities, to increase direct mail response rates.\n",
    ".Customer Retention in the form of pattern identification and prediction of likely defections is possible by Data mining.\n",
    ".Risk Assessment and Fraud area also use the data-mining concept for identifying inappropriate or unusual behavior etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Give an example of the Apriori algorithm for learning association rules.\n",
    "Ans:-Apriori Algorithm is one of the algorithm used for transaction data in Association Rule Learning. It allows us to\n",
    "    mine the frequent itemset in order to generate association rule between them.\n",
    "Example: list of items purchased by customers, details of website which are frequently visited etc\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This algorithm was introduced by Agrawal and Srikant in 1994.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principles behind Apriori Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Subset of frequent itemset are frequent itemset.\n",
    "Superset of infrequent itemset are infrequent itemset.\n",
    "I know you are wondering this is too technical but donâ€™t worry you will get it once we see how it works!\n",
    "\n",
    "Apriori Algorithm has three parts:\n",
    "1. Support\n",
    "2. Confidence\n",
    "3. Lift\n",
    "\n",
    "Support( I )=\n",
    "( Number of transactions containing item I ) / ( Total number of transactions )\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence( I1 -> I2 ) =\n",
    "( Number of transactions containing I1 and I2 ) / ( Number of transactions containing I1 )\n",
    "\n",
    "Lift( I1 -> I2 ) = ( Confidence( I1 -> I2 ) / ( Support(I2) )\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm in a nutshell\n",
    "1. Set a minimum support and confidence.\n",
    "2. Take all the subset present in the transactions which have higher support than minimum support.\n",
    "3. Take all the rules of these subsets which have higher confidence than minimum confidence.\n",
    "4. Sort the rules by decreasing lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Approach to Apriori Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the transaction dataset of a store where each transaction contains the list of items purchased by the customers. \n",
    "Our goal is to find frequent set of items that are purchased by the customers and generate the association rules for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In hierarchical clustering, how is the distance between clusters measured? Explain how this metric\n",
    "is used to decide when to end the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-single linkage hierarchical clustering\n",
    "In single linkage hierarchical clustering, the distance between two clusters is defined as the shortest distance between\n",
    "two points in each cluster.\n",
    "                    \n",
    "5. In the k-means algorithm, how do you recompute the cluster centroids?\n",
    "Ans:-Introduction to K-Means Clustering\n",
    "1.Step 1: Choose the number of clusters k. ...\n",
    "2.Step 2: Select k random points from the data as centroids. ...\n",
    "3.Step 3: Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid. ...\n",
    "4.Step 4: Recompute the centroids of newly formed clusters. ...\n",
    "5.Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4.\n",
    "                    \n",
    "6. At the start of the clustering exercise, discuss one method for determining the required number of\n",
    "clusters.\n",
    "Ans:- Determining the optimal number of clusters in a data set is a fundamental issue in partitioning clustering, such as\n",
    "    k-means clustering, which requires the user to specify the number of clusters k to be generated.\n",
    "                    \n",
    "  These methods include direct methods and statistical testing methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Direct methods: consists of optimizing a criterion, such as the within cluster sums of squares or the average silhouette.\n",
    " The corresponding methods are named elbow and silhouette methods, respectively.\n",
    "                    \n",
    "2.Statistical testing methods: consists of comparing evidence against null hypothesis. An example is the gap statistic\n",
    "                    \n",
    "                    \n",
    "7. Discuss the k-means algorithm's advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "Ans:-K-means algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into Kpre-defined distinct \n",
    "     non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group.\n",
    "                    \n"
