    "1. What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data \n",
    "    and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-Machine learning algorithms have had good results on problems such has spam detection in email, cancer diagnosis, \n",
    "    fraudulent credit card transactions, and automatically driving vehicles.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?\n",
    "Ans:- The training set is used to train the algorithm, and then you use the trained model on the test set to predict the \n",
    "     response variable values that are already known. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?\n",
    "Ans:- The two most common supervised tasks are regression and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?\n",
    "Ans:- Common unsupervised tasks include clustering, visualization, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6.State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various\n",
    "unfamiliar terrains?\n",
    "Ans:- The best Machine Learning algorithm to allow a robot to walk in unknown terrain is Reinforced Learning, where the \n",
    "    robot can learn from response of the terrain to optimize itself.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7.Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?\n",
    "Ans:- In a business context: Clustering algorithm is a technique that assists customer segmentation which is a process of\n",
    "        classifying similar customers into the same segment. Clustering algorithm helps to better understand customers, \n",
    "        in terms of both static demographics and dynamic behaviors\n",
    "        \n",
    "8.Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning\n",
    "problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Spam detection is a supervised machine learning problem. This means you must provide your machine learning model \n",
    "    with a set of examples of spam and ham messages and let it find the relevant patterns that separate the two different\n",
    "    categories.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9.What is the concept of an online learning system?\n",
    "Ans:- Online learning is education that takes place over the Internet. It is often referred to as “e- learning” among \n",
    "    other terms. However, online learning is just one type of “distance learning” - the umbrella term for any learning \n",
    "    that takes place across distance and not in a traditional classroom.\n",
    "    \n",
    "10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?\n",
    "Ans:- Out-of-core leanring refers to the machine learning algorithms working with data cannot fit into the memory of a \n",
    "    single machine, but that can easily fit into some data storage such as local hard disk or web repository.\n",
    "    \n",
    "11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?\n",
    "Ans:- Learning algorithm that relies on a similarity measure to make predictions is instance-based algorithm.\n",
    "    \n",
    "12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning\n",
    "algorithm?\n",
    "Ans:- Model Parameters: These are the parameters in the model that must be determined using the training data set. \n",
    "        These are the fitted parameters. Hyperparameters: These are adjustable parameters that must be tuned in order to\n",
    "            obtain a model with optimal performance.\n",
    "            \n",
    "13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular\n",
    "method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?\n",
    "Ans:-Model based learning algorithm search for the optimal value of parameters in a model that will give the best results \n",
    "    for the new instances. We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in \n",
    "    order to minimize the function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "14.Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?\n",
    "Ans:-Four main challenges in Machine Learning include \n",
    "    .overfitting the data (using a model too complicated),\n",
    "    .underfitting the data (using a simple model), \n",
    "    .lacking in data and\n",
    "    .nonrepresentative data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results\n",
    "to new situations? Can you think of three different options?\n",
    "Ans:-model is overfitting your training data when you see that the model performs well on the training data but does not \n",
    "    perform well on the evaluation data. This is because the model is memorizing the data it has seen and is unable to \n",
    "    generalize to unseen examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Poor performance on the training data could be because the model is too simple (the input features are not expressive \n",
    "    enough) to describe the target well. Performance can be improved by increasing model flexibility. To increase model\n",
    "    flexibility, try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    ".Add new domain-specific features and more feature Cartesian products, and change the types of feature processing used \n",
    "(e.g., increasing n-grams size)\n",
    "\n",
    ".Decrease the amount of regularization used\n",
    "\n",
    "16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?\n",
    "Ans:-A test set is therefore a set of examples used only to assess the performance (i.e. generalization) of a fully \n",
    "    specified classifier. To do this, the final model is used to predict classifications of examples in the test set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "17.What is a validation set's purpose?\n",
    "Ans:- A validation set is a set of data used to train artificial intelligence (AI) with the goal of finding and optimizing\n",
    "    the best model to solve a given problem. Validation sets are also known as dev sets. A supervised AI is trained on a \n",
    "    corpus of training data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?\n",
    "Ans:- Cross-validation is a tool to compare models without needing a separate validation set. It is preferred over \n",
    "    validation set because we can save from breaking of part of the training set to create a validation set, as having\n",
    "    more data is valuable regardless.\n",
    "    \n",
    "19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?\n",
    "Ans:- If you use this data to choose hyperparameters, you actually give the model a chance to \"see\" the test data and to \n",
    "    develop a bias towards this test data. Therefore, you actually lose the possibility to find out how good your model\n",
    "    would actually be on unseen data (because it has already seen the test data)."
